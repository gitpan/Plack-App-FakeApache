NAME
    Plack::App::FakeApache - Wrapping mod_perl2 applications in Plack

SYNOPSIS
      use Plack::App::FakeApache;

      my $app = Plack::App::FakeApache->new( 
        handler    => "My::ResponseHandler"
        dir_config => { ... }
      )->to_app;

DESCRIPTION
    Plack::App::FakeApache transforms a mod_perl2 application into a PSGI
    application

NOTICE
    This is Proof of Concept code originating in the mocking code developed
    to test an internal very non-trivial mod_perl2 application. Features
    have been added on a need to have basis.

CONFIGURATION
    handler (required)
    dir_config
        Hash used to resolve $req->dir_config() requests

APACHE METHODS
    The following methods from Apache2::RequestRec and mixins are supported:

    headers_in
    headers_out
    subprecess_env
    dir_config
    method
    unparsed_uri
    uri
    user
    hostname
    content_type
    content_encoding
    status
    log_reason (implemented as a no-op)
    read
    print
    write

PLACK METHODS
    A few methods have been added to the interface to enable interaction
    with Plack:

    plack_request
        Returns the underling Plack::Request object

    plack_response
        Returns the underlying Plack::Response object. During the request
        phase this is incomplete.

    finalize
        Fills information into the response object and finalizes it.
